# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and match `config.py:VERSION`.

## [1.23.0]

### Added
- **Home conversion funnel & onboarding wizard.** New design tokens, utility
  classes, and a toast notification system (replacing `alert()` for non-blocking
  feedback); a guided onboarding checklist on the homepage; `GET /api/pricing`
  exposes the credit-cost/package configuration so the frontend never hardcodes
  prices that could drift from `config.py`.
- **Readings Hub.** A dedicated page surfacing every paid reading type as a
  priced card (sourced from `/api/pricing`), including a new Varshaphala
  (annual return) streaming flow.
- **Mobile navigation.** A sticky bottom nav bar and sticky calculate buttons
  for small screens; drawer cleanup.
- **Profile modal reorganized into sub-tabs** (Settings / Saved Profiles /
  Billing & History) with skeleton-shimmer loading states and an account
  deletion flow.

### Fixed
- The onboarding wizard's "Save your birth details" step opened a completely
  blank profile modal (`switchProfileTab` didn't recognise the `birth-info`
  tab id used by the wizard link) — aliased to the `settings` pane, which is
  where the birth-info fields actually live.
- The new Varshaphala streaming call omitted the backend's required
  `client_name`/`place_name` fields, so every request was rejected with a 422
  before any prediction ran — the Readings Hub's flagship feature never
  worked. Added the missing fields (matching the sibling remedies call).
- A stray extra closing `</div>` from the profile-modal reorg closed
  `.app-container` early and left the document's div-nesting unbalanced,
  reparenting every modal after the profile modal in the source. Removed.
- Reopening the profile modal after a billing action (buy credits / subscribe
  / cancel) always reset to the Settings tab, hiding the Billing tab update
  the user just triggered. It now returns to whichever tab was last active.
- Removed two hardcoded 600ms artificial delays inserted purely to showcase
  the new skeleton-shimmer loaders after the real data had already arrived.
- `GET /api/pricing` was awaited at the top of `window.onload`, blocking the
  homepage's actual critical-path init (today's panchangam, calendar) on a
  round-trip the Readings Hub doesn't need until visited. Now fetched
  fire-and-forget against sensible hardcoded fallbacks.
- The premium-PDF button/price label used a separate hardcoded 150-credit
  constant instead of the same `pricing.pdf_premium` value driving the
  Readings Hub cards, risking drift if the cost is ever repriced. Consolidated.

## [1.22.0]

### Added
- **Tiered PDF reports.** `/api/download-pdf` now takes a `tier` field. `basic`
  is the existing selectable-section report (unchanged, synchronous). `premium`
  (`CREDIT_COST_PDF_PREMIUM`=150) is a 20+ page chaptered life report —
  personality (Lagna/Moon/Sun), career & wealth (10th/D10, 2nd/11th), marriage
  & health (7th/D9, 6th/8th), and dasa outlook & remedies — each group written
  by ONE grounded LLM call (≤4 total) with chapter-targeted RAG passages, atop
  the existing deterministic tables (charts, Shadbala/Ashtakavarga, dasa) and
  full Indic-font machinery. Premium generation is **async**: the POST debits
  then returns a `report_id`; a background task builds the PDF into a gitignored
  `reports/` dir with an unguessable name; `GET /api/report-status/{id}` polls;
  `GET /api/report-file/{id}` serves it session-gated. On generation failure the
  debit is **refunded** via the existing ledger round-trip. A tier chooser with
  a page-count/contents preview and price drives it from the PDF button; a 402
  opens the paywall.
- **Gift a reading.** Buy a single-use gift code (`credit_pack` or
  `premium_pdf_voucher`) via `POST /api/billing/create-gift-order` → Razorpay →
  `verify-gift-payment` **and** the webhook, both converging on the idempotent
  `_grant_gift_for_order` (atomic status flip on the `gift_orders.payment_intent_id`
  UNIQUE, minting the code exactly once). GST via `config.gst_breakdown`;
  unconfigured Razorpay → 503; `VEDIC_ALLOW_SIMULATED_PAYMENTS` enables a local
  `buy-gift`. `POST /api/billing/redeem-gift` redeems atomically (single-use via
  `UPDATE … WHERE redeemed_by_user_id IS NULL`), credits the redeemer, and blocks
  self-redemption (`GIFT_SELF_REDEEM`=0). A shareable gift card + `/gift/{code}`
  landing page routes to sign-in-then-redeem.
- **WhatsApp delivery (Meta Cloud API).** New `whatsapp_sender.py` sends
  pre-approved templates (`report_ready`, `daily_digest`) in all six languages,
  failing closed unless `WHATSAPP_ENABLED`. Finished premium reports are
  delivered over WhatsApp via a session-less, self-expiring **signed link**
  (HMAC over `report_id|expiry`, `REPORT_LINK_TTL_HOURS`=72). Phone collection is
  an optional, E.164-validated field on `/api/auth/profile/update` with an
  explicit `whatsapp_opt_in` consent flag + timestamp; opt-out is honored
  immediately. `/api/whatsapp/webhook` verifies the `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC
  (GET handshake echoes the verify token) and auto-opts-out on inbound
  STOP/UNSUBSCRIBE in any supported language. The daily digest gains a `whatsapp`
  channel alongside `email`.

## [1.21.1]

### Fixed
- **Citation manifest JSON leaking into AI readings.** The frontend's shared
  `processStreamChunk` only stripped the leading citation-manifest line on
  the one call that first parsed it; every later stream chunk fell back to
  the raw accumulated text, so the manifest JSON reappeared permanently
  ahead of the rendered Astro-AI reading/chat/marriage-compatibility output.
  It now tracks the manifest offset per-stream (in a state object owned by
  each caller, not a shared global — two AI streams can be in flight at once,
  e.g. an auto-generated Jyothi reading alongside a chat message) and always
  strips it. The marriage compatibility reading never stripped the manifest
  at all; wired in.
- **Astro-AI chat answering in the wrong language.** `/api/ai-predict-chat`
  and `/api/query` had no language instruction in their prompts (unlike
  `/api/ai-predict`), so the model would drift into whichever language the
  retrieved classical passages leaned toward — often Hindi/Sanskrit — instead
  of the page's selected language, especially when the question was typed in
  English. Both endpoints now accept `lang` and require the reply to stay in
  that language regardless of the question's language.

## [1.21.0]

### Added
- **Muhurtham for more life events.** `muhurtham_engine` gains declarative
  electional profiles (`ACTIVITY_PROFILES`) and three new activities —
  `BUSINESS_OPENING`, `NAMAKARANA`, `TRAVEL` — alongside strengthened
  `GRAHAPRAVESHA`/`AKSHARABHYASAM`/`VAHAN_KHARIDI`: per-event nakshatra
  whitelists (Bharani/Krittika hard-forbidden for travel), riktha-tithi +
  Amavasya guards, weekday guards, and the universal Vishti-karana block.
  `GET/POST /api/muhurtham` accepts the new `target_activity` values, and the
  public SEO panchangam pages now show a localized "Auspicious today for"
  line (housewarming, first learning, vehicle purchase, business opening,
  naming, travel) — new search keywords per city/day. VIVAHA's dedicated rule
  chain is unchanged.
- **Varshaphala (Tajika annual chart).** `astro_engine.get_varshaphala_chart`
  finds the exact sidereal solar-return moment (Newton search, natal
  ayanamsa, ±seconds), casts the annual chart at the natal place, and derives
  Muntha (natal lagna + one rasi per completed year, with its house from the
  varsha lagna) and the year lord (strongest office-bearer candidate by
  Shadbala). New `POST /api/ai-predict-varshaphala` streams the year-ahead
  reading grounded via Tajika-targeted RAG queries
  (`CREDIT_COST_VARSHAPHALA`=25, rate-limited LLM action).
- **Grounded remedies (parihara).** `prediction_engine.derive_remedy_targets`
  flags only computed afflictions — afflicted running dasa lords
  (debilitated/combust/dusthana), Sade Sati / Ashtama / Kantaka Shani from
  gochara, an afflicted lagna lord, malefics on the lagna. New
  `POST /api/ai-remedies` retrieves remedy-focused passages and instructs the
  model to recommend ONLY text-supported remedies with per-remedy citations
  (never inventing mantras/gemstones), framed as traditional spiritual
  guidance (`CREDIT_COST_REMEDIES`=25). A "Get Classical Remedies" button
  appears on the astrology tab after a chart is calculated.
- **In-depth AI compatibility (premium).**
  `prediction_engine.build_compatibility_analysis` computes the cross-chart
  layer beyond porutham: each native's 7th house/lord condition,
  Venus/Jupiter karaka dignities, the mutual Moon-sign relation
  (samasaptaka/dwirdwadasha/shashtashtama/trikona), the Kuja-dosha verdict
  WITH the porutham engine's classical cancellations (never re-flagged from
  bare placement), and 10-year simultaneous malefic-mahadasa windows (dasa
  sandhi). New `POST /api/ai-predict-compatibility`
  (`CREDIT_COST_COMPATIBILITY`=75) with an upsell button under the marriage
  reading.
- **Prashna (horary) mode.** `POST /api/ai-predict-prashna` answers a typed
  question from the chart of the moment at the querent's location — no birth
  details needed (the lowest-friction paid entry point). A keyword map (no
  extra LLM call) routes the question to its judged house (career→10th,
  marriage→7th, lost objects→2nd, …); `build_prashna_analysis` renders the
  lagna lord / Moon / judged-house conditions for the prompt
  (`CREDIT_COST_PRASHNA`=25). New "Ask a Question" card on the AI tab.
- **CI** now also runs `test_depth_features.py` (muhurtham profile fixtures +
  matrix consistency, solar-return accuracy ±2 min, Muntha progression,
  remedy-target derivation, compatibility analysis, prashna classifier).

## [1.20.0]

### Added
- **Daily personalized transit digest (opt-in).** New `digest_engine.py` builds
  a deterministic multilingual daily briefing from the user's saved birth info:
  today's panchangam (tithi/nakshatra/yogam, sunrise/sunset, Rahu Kalam /
  Yamagandam / Gulika Kalam — same weekday-part math as the frontend card),
  the running Vimshottari maha/antar dasa, and gochara highlights (Sade Sati,
  Ashtama/Kantaka Shani, Guru Bala, Chandrashtama) in all six languages.
  Opt-in/out via `POST /api/user/digest/subscribe|unsubscribe` (session-gated,
  free, requires saved birth details) and a toggle in the profile's Account
  Preferences. Delivery is the cron-invoked `tools/send_digests.py` over SMTP
  (`VEDIC_SMTP_*`, fails closed when unconfigured; `--dry-run` to preview);
  every email carries a tokenless one-click unsubscribe link
  (`/digest/unsubscribe/{token}`). Astro Pass subscribers optionally get the
  text polished once by `MODEL_FAST` (`VEDIC_DIGEST_LLM=0` disables), with the
  deterministic text always the fallback.
- **Shareable public chart links.** `POST /api/user/charts/{id}/share` mints an
  unguessable slug (revoked via DELETE, or automatically when the chart is
  deleted); the new Share button on saved-chart cards copies the URL. The
  public `/share/{slug}` page server-renders a read-only chart — South-Indian
  Rasi + Navamsha grids, placements with dignities, current maha dasa, birth
  panchangam — with OpenGraph tags and a generated `/share/{slug}/og.png`
  preview card (PyMuPDF). No AI content; `noindex`; an optional
  `hide_birth_details` flag redacts date/time/place.
- **Public SEO panchangam pages.** `/panchangam/{lang}/{city}/{YYYY-MM-DD}`
  (80 curated cities in `cities.py`, 6 languages) server-renders the full day
  panchangam — tithi/nakshatra/yogam/karanam via the `translations.py` single
  source, sunrise/sunset, Rahu/Yama/Gulika windows, regional date/year,
  festival + marriage-muhurtham badges — with canonical + hreflang alternates,
  JSON-LD, prev/next links, and a bounded LRU cache (day panchangam is
  immutable). `/festivals/{lang}/{YYYY-MM}` lists the month's festivals/vratams
  (reusing the month-calendar engine and its cache), and `/sitemap.xml`
  (streamed) + `/robots.txt` expose it all to crawlers. `VEDIC_PORTAL_BASE_URL`
  configures the public origin used in links.
- **CI** now also runs `test_growth_features.py` (kalam windows, digest
  builder + label-table alignment across languages, city table integrity).

## [1.19.0]

### Fixed
- **AI predictions no longer hallucinate positions/strengths.** The Astro-AI
  chat prompt told the model to *"assume the user has provided"* Shodasavarga (16
  divisional charts), Vimsopaka Bala, Arudha Pada, Kalachakra Dasa, the 22nd
  Drekkana and Avasthas — none of which are computed — so it fabricated bhava
  placements, aspects and strengths. Rewrote the prompt to describe exactly what
  the computed analysis contains (D1 plus the D3/D9/D10/D12/D30/D60 vargas,
  house lords, conjunctions, full graha drishti, Shadbala components,
  Ashtakavarga, running Dasa-Bhukti-Antaram, gochara) and forbid inventing any
  datum not present. The `/api/ai-predict` prompt gained the same
  computed-data-only guardrail.
- **Sthana Phala & Drik Phala are now fed to the LLM.** `build_analysis` only
  exposed Shadbala *totals*; it now emits the full six-fold breakdown per planet
  (Sthana/Dig/Kala/Cheshta/Naisargika/Drik), so readings reason from real
  positional (Sthana) and aspectual (Drik) strengths instead of guessing them.

### Added
- **AI "preview phala" — auto-generated, cached, premium.** For Astro Pass
  members the AI reading now generates automatically once a chart is calculated
  and is cached on the chart (per language) so it is never regenerated or the
  viewport re-scrolled; it is also embedded into the PDF. Non-premium users see a
  locked button that opens the paywall. Enforced server-side on `/api/ai-predict`.
- **Selectable, reordered PDF report.** The download icon now opens a section
  picker. Report order changed to: chart details & planet positions → **all
  divisional (Varga) charts D1–D60** → Shadbala & Ashtakavarga → **AI preview
  phala** → **Vimshottari Dasa (now last)**. Premium members can include every
  section; non-premium users are limited to *chart details & planet positions*
  (free — `CREDIT_COST_PDF_BASIC=0`), with the full report still costing
  `CREDIT_COST_PDF`. The dasa page's "Birth Moon Nakshatram" subtitle now shows
  the birth nakshatra (previously leaked the last planet's nakshatra).

## [1.18.6]

### Fixed
- **Broken calendar festival images + huge asset payload.** Three festival
  mappings in `getFestivalImage` pointed at filenames that don't exist, so those
  days showed a broken image: Ekadashi → `venkateswara_symbols.png` (actual file
  `lord_venkateswara.png`), Diwali → `diya.png` (actual `diya_lamp.png`), and
  Marriage Muhurtham → `hindu_marriage_couple.png` (no asset — now maps to the
  auspicious `kalasam.png`). Separately, the deity/festival PNGs were 1024px and
  ~0.7–1.1 MB **each** (≈24 MB total) while displayed at 56px in the grid (and
  ~190px in the hero), so they loaded slowly and sometimes failed. Resized all to
  512px and palette-optimized them with Pillow: **~24 MB → ~1.7 MB** (deity art
  ~1 MB → ~130 KB; icons → ~15 KB), with no visible quality loss at display size.
  Festival thumbnails also gained `loading="lazy"`/`decoding="async"` and a
  cache-buster bump. (The unused `cosmic_galaxy_bg.png` was left untouched.)

## [1.18.5]

### Fixed
- **Calendar details now load fast (`/api/month-panchangam`).** The grid filled
  in slowly — each month took ~5s and *nothing was cached*, so revisiting or
  prefetching a month recomputed it every time. Two causes, both fixed:
  - The per-day Swiss Ephemeris math ran ~10-15× slower inside FastAPI's sync
    threadpool than on the main thread (a GIL/pyswisseph interaction; verified
    by profiling: 0.37s on the main thread vs 5.5s in a worker thread). The
    endpoint is now `async` and computes on the event loop, so a cold month is
    **~0.37s instead of ~5s**, and the calendar's concurrent current+prev+next
    prefetch requests serialize cleanly instead of thrashing the GIL.
  - Added a bounded in-memory **LRU cache** (a month is fully determined by
    year/month/language/location, so it never changes) — repeat and prefetched
    months are now **instant** instead of recomputed.

### Added
- **`tools/test_calendar_nav.py`** — a Playwright navigation test that drives the
  live calendar and asserts month switching renders exactly one clean month
  (regression guard for the double-render glitch) and repaints without blocking
  on the fetch. Falls back to the bundled Chromium when no system Chrome exists.

## [1.18.4]

### Fixed
- **Calendar: instant month switching, no more double-render glitch.**
  `renderMonthlyCalendar` cleared the grid *before* awaiting the month-panchangam
  fetch and appended cells *after*, so overlapping month changes (or concurrent
  callers) interleaved and painted two or three months into the grid at once, and
  every uncached month blocked on the network. Rewritten so:
  - Renders commit **atomically** (`replaceChildren` of a prebuilt fragment) and
    a monotonic **render token** makes a newer render cancel any stale in-flight
    one — eliminating the multiple-months overlap.
  - Switching to a month paints an **instant day-number skeleton**, then enriches
    it when the data arrives, so navigation is never blocked on the fetch.
  - The **previous and next months are prefetched** into the cache after each
    render, so stepping through months is an instant cache hit.
  - A 0.16s grid fade makes the transition smooth (respects reduced-motion).

## [1.18.3]

### Changed
- **OTP login is now MSG91 SMS only — Twilio removed.** Dropped the Twilio
  SMS/WhatsApp integration (the `_send_twilio_otp` sender, the `TWILIO_*` config
  and `.env.example` block, and the import). `_send_otp_via_api` now sends solely
  via MSG91, and the request channel defaults to `sms`. Since WhatsApp had no
  remaining provider, the auth modal's WhatsApp/SMS channel toggle is removed
  (OTP is SMS-only) and the profile "preferred channel" select offers SMS only.

## [1.18.2]

### Fixed
- **App title went out of view in Tamil & Malayalam (real cause).** The 1.18.1
  line-height tweak addressed glyph clipping but not the actual problem: in a
  crowded header (wide Indic nav tabs + a long detected location like
  "Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, Ile-de-France"), the longer translated title wrapped to
  a second line that was pushed *above* the fixed 64px header and out of view —
  only "ஆஸ்ட்ரோ AI" / "ആസ്ട്രോ AI" remained, with the leading "வைதிக" / "വൈദിക"
  gone. Now:
  - The title and subtitle never wrap (`white-space: nowrap`, with an ellipsis
    fallback only if truly cramped), and the brand block no longer shrinks on
    desktop, so the full title always stays on one line and in view.
  - The location chip is width-capped with an ellipsis so a long place name can't
    crowd out the title.
  - For long-script languages (everything but English) the top nav collapses into
    the existing side drawer below 1450px — the drawer already holds all
    navigation, language, and settings. English desktops are unchanged.
  Verified across widths with headless-Chrome renders of the Tamil header.

## [1.18.1]

### Fixed
- **App title was clipped in Tamil & Malayalam.** The header title (`#lbl-title`)
  and the side-nav title use a saffron gradient via `-webkit-background-clip:
  text`, which clips the fill to a tight line box. With `line-height: 1.2` that
  box shaved the tall vowel marks/conjuncts of the Tamil "வைதிக …" and Malayalam
  "വൈദിക …" titles (the leading word looked cut). Gave both a roomier line box
  (`line-height: 1.5`) and small vertical padding so the full glyphs render; the
  gradient is preserved and the titles still fit the 64px header.

## [1.18.0]

### Changed
- **Refined Saffron visual refresh.** Kept the warm saffron identity but made it
  read as a deliberate, calm design rather than maximalist. Driven entirely
  through the `:root` token layer (markup untouched):
  - **Body text is now warm charcoal** (`--text-primary` #2b2018) with a warm
    grey-brown muted tier, instead of everything being rust-orange — copy reads
    calm and neutral, and saffron/gold is reserved for things that mean
    something (titles, the active-tab indicator, card top-edges, omen states).
  - **Quieter cards** — softened borders and a neutral lift shadow replace the
    golden glow; the active nav tab now uses a clean saffron underline instead
    of a glow box.
  - **Calmer canvas** — the background nebulae and the two static star layers are
    dialed well down for a soft-cream field.

## [1.17.0]

### Changed
- **Daily Kaalams panel is now scannable at a glance.** The "Daily Kaalams &
  Auspicious Timings" list was a plain bulleted list whose colors were arbitrary
  and inconsistent (auspicious windows showed up as green *and* gold *and*
  violet; inauspicious as red *and* brown), so the day's good/bad windows didn't
  read as a system. It's now a set of omen rows with **one consistent color
  language** — green = auspicious, red = inauspicious, amber = neutral — each
  with a status dot and a colored left edge so red (avoid) and green (favorable)
  windows jump out immediately. All `lbl-*`/`panch-*` label IDs are unchanged, so
  translations are unaffected. Removed the unused `.kaalams-*` styles this
  replaces.

## [1.16.3]

### Changed
- **Frontend performance & accessibility pass (no visual redesign).** Removed
  the always-on infinite animations that drove constant GPU repaints: the two
  full-screen twinkling star fields are now painted once and promoted to their
  own compositor layer (`translateZ(0)`), the 950px OM watermark is held static,
  the per-card shimmer sweep (which ran one animation *per card* simultaneously)
  is now a static gold edge, and the pulsing mantra text-shadow is static. The
  orbiting-planet signature motion is kept.
- **Indic webfonts now load on demand.** Only the Latin faces (Inter, Space
  Grotesk, Lora) load up front; the heavy Noto Sans Tamil/Telugu/Kannada/
  Malayalam/Devanagari faces are fetched lazily for the selected language via
  `ensureLangFont()` (hooked into `changeLanguage`), instead of loading all five
  on every page view.

### Added
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` support.** Users who request reduced motion at the
  OS level now get the orbiting planets, spinning dharma wheels, blinking
  cursors, and all transitions stilled.

## [1.16.2]

### Added
- **`GET /api/source` — automated AGPL §13 source offer.** Serves the complete
  corresponding source of the running version as a versioned `.tar.gz`, free of
  charge and with no auth (public; not key- or session-gated). The footer now
  links to it as "Download source" (replacing the email-on-request offer). Built
  from `git archive HEAD` in dev and baked into the Docker image at build time
  for prod (the image has no `git`); either path includes only tracked files, so
  `.env`/`.api_key`/`*.db` can never leak. `source.tar.gz` is gitignored.

## [1.16.1]

### Changed
- **Removed the direct source-repo links from the UI.** The footer and side-nav
  no longer hyperlink to the GitHub repository (the repo is now private). They
  still show the **GNU AGPL-3.0** license (linking to the gnu.org license text)
  and now satisfy the §13 network-use clause via a **source-on-request** contact
  (`source@vedicastroai.net`) instead of a repo link. README updated to match.
  *(That mailbox must be live and deliver the exact corresponding source.)*

## [1.16.0]

### Changed
- **Shared API key no longer gates the whole API — only the corpus/admin
  endpoints.** Previously every `/api/*` call (except a few open paths) required
  the operator key, so a new visitor on a fresh browser was prompted for a key on
  page load (the loopback-only `/api/local-key` can't reach a remote user). The
  key now gates **only** `/api/search`, `/api/page-image`, `/api/page-text`,
  `/api/status`, `/api/books` (the OCR'd corpus / ingest internals). Everything
  else is either public (panchangam, version, health) or already protected
  per-user by session tokens + credits (401/402) — so ordinary visitors are never
  prompted. The frontend's key prompt is lazy and now effectively never fires for
  end users. New flag `VEDIC_REQUIRE_API_KEY` (default `1`); set `0` to drop the
  operator key entirely and make the corpus endpoints public too.

## [1.15.5]

### Added
- **AGPL source-availability link in the UI.** A site footer ("© · GNU AGPL-3.0 ·
  Source code") and a "Source code" row in the side-nav About section now link to
  the repository and `LICENSE`, satisfying the AGPL §13 obligation to offer the
  corresponding source to users of a hosted instance. *(Requires the linked repo
  to be reachable by users — make it public or point the link at your source.)*

## [1.15.4]

### Added
- **Bundled Swiss Ephemeris data (`ephe/`).** Ships `sepl_18.se1` + `semo_18.se1`
  (Sun/planets + Moon, 1800–2399 CE) so the engine computes high-precision
  positions instead of the Moshier fallback; `/api/health` reports
  `ephemeris: ok`. Dates outside the range still fall back to Moshier per-call.
  Swiss Ephemeris is used under the AGPL (see project `LICENSE`); the data files'
  own notice is preserved in `ephe/LICENSE`, with details in `ephe/README.md`.

## [1.15.3]

### Added
- **Adopted GNU AGPL v3.0 (`LICENSE`).** The project is now formally licensed
  under the AGPL — required (the free path) by its Swiss Ephemeris / `pyswisseph`
  dependency, which is dual-licensed AGPL-or-paid. README gains a **License**
  section noting the AGPL §13 network-use obligation (offer source to users of a
  hosted instance). The alternative remains a paid Astrodienst Professional
  License (see `ephe/LICENSE`) or removing Swiss Ephemeris.

## [1.15.2]

### Added
- **Bundled Noto fonts (`fonts/`).** The Noto Sans Regular/Bold faces for Latin,
  Tamil, Telugu, Devanagari, Kannada and Malayalam now ship in the repo, so
  multilingual PDF reports render on any host without relying on a system Noto
  install. `pdf_generator.py` already prefers the bundled dir, so `/api/health`
  reports `pdf_fonts: ok` out of the box. Fonts are SIL OFL 1.1 (`fonts/OFL.txt`).

## [1.15.1]

### Fixed
- **RAG index never loaded (critical).** `search_engine.load_index()` referenced
  `page_map`/`emb_list` before initialising them, raising a `NameError` that the
  broad `except` swallowed — leaving the in-memory index permanently empty. Every
  AI prediction/chat/marriage reading ran with zero grounding passages, and
  `/api/health` reported the index `degraded` forever. Added the missing locals
  plus a seeded-load regression test (`test_search_index_load.py`).
- **Profile location autocomplete hit a non-existent `/api/search-places`.** The
  profile birth-info place field now queries Nominatim directly, matching the
  birth-chart forms.
- **International charts ignored DST.** `BirthChartRequest` (and the marriage
  sub-requests) now accept an optional `timezone_offset` (hours) that overrides
  the engine's DST-unaware bounding-box estimate; India/IST is unaffected. The
  birth and marriage forms expose an optional **UTC Offset** field (blank = auto
  estimate) so interactive users abroad can correct for DST, not just API callers.
- **Billing verify IDOR hardening.** `verify-payment`/`verify-subscription` now
  assert the order/subscription belongs to the authenticated session user
  (403 otherwise) before crediting; the HMAC-verified webhook path is unchanged.
  Covered by new ownership-guard unit tests in `test_unit.py`.
- **`/api/status` index-reload churn.** The reload now fires only when the
  vectorized-page count actually grows, so mismatched-dimension rows no longer
  trigger a full corpus `SELECT` on every status poll.
- **Marriage Vedha Porutham had a non-standard triangle.** The `vedha_pairs` set
  made Mrigashira, Hasta and Dhanishta mutually Vedha. Replaced it with the
  canonical 13-pair Vedha list (per B.V. Raman's *Muhurtha* / standard
  panchangas); each nakshatra now has at most one Vedha partner and Chitra is
  correctly left unpaired (its counterpart Abhijit is the unenumerated 28th).
- **Swiss Ephemeris ran silently on the Moshier fallback.** `astro_engine` now
  calls `swe.set_ephe_path(EPHE_PATH)` when `*.se1` data files are present and
  warns at startup otherwise; `/api/health` reports `ephemeris: ok|degraded`.
- **Indic PDF fonts failed silently.** Font files now resolve from a bundled
  `fonts/` dir (then the system Noto dir, overridable via `VEDIC_FONT_DIR`);
  missing Indic faces warn at startup and surface as `pdf_fonts` in `/api/health`.
- **Third-party browser calls could hang the UI.** Nominatim lookups now go
  through a `fetchExternal` helper with a 6s timeout so a slow/down external
  service no longer stalls the page.
- **IP-geolocation privacy.** The browser no longer calls `ipapi.co` directly;
  IP geolocation is proxied through a new server-side `GET /api/detect-location`
  (honours `X-Forwarded-For`, 5s timeout, fails soft). The third party now sees
  only an opaque server request, not the visitor's User-Agent/headers/cookies.

### Changed
- `users.credit_balance` column default is now `SIGNUP_BONUS_CREDITS` (25)
  instead of a hardcoded 100, so raw inserts/migrations match the signup path.
- Legacy simulated `/api/billing/subscribe` now writes `platform_subscription_id`
  (consistent with the Razorpay path) and uses `SUBSCRIPTION_REFILL_CREDITS`
  instead of a hardcoded 5000.
- New env-overridable paths: `VEDIC_EPHE_PATH` (Swiss Ephemeris data dir) and
  `VEDIC_FONT_DIR` (system font dir for PDF rendering).

### Data
- Migrated the RAG corpus (8 books / 3,710 pages, all 1536-dim embeddings) from
  the legacy combined DB into the post-split `vedic_rag.db`, which had been left
  empty by the user/RAG database split. No re-OCR or re-embedding was required.

## [1.15.0]

### Added
- **Astro Pass recurring subscription (real Razorpay Subscriptions).** Replaces
  the simulated 30-day pass with true auto-renewing billing:
  - `POST /api/billing/create-subscription` creates a Razorpay Subscription
    against a dashboard-created Plan (`RAZORPAY_PLAN_ID`) and records it pending.
  - `POST /api/billing/verify-subscription` validates the Checkout callback
    signature (HMAC of `payment_id|subscription_id` — **reversed** vs one-time
    orders) and activates the pass.
  - The webhook now also handles `subscription.charged` (authoritative renewal:
    extends the access window by `SUBSCRIPTION_PERIOD_DAYS` + grants the
    per-cycle refill) and `subscription.cancelled`/`halted`/`completed`
    (revokes). All renewals are **idempotent** on the charge `payment_id` via the
    `transactions` UNIQUE key, so webhook retries can't double-credit.
  - Cancel now calls Razorpay with `cancel_at_cycle_end` so users keep the access
    they paid for until period end.
  - Frontend `subscribeTier` opens Razorpay Checkout with the `subscription_id`
    to authorise the UPI Autopay / card mandate.
- New config (env-overridable): `RAZORPAY_PLAN_ID`, `SUBSCRIPTION_TOTAL_COUNT`,
  `SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_PAISE`, `SUBSCRIPTION_REFILL_CREDITS`,
  `SUBSCRIPTION_PERIOD_DAYS`. Subscription endpoints **fail closed (503)** without
  Razorpay keys / plan id.
- `test_razorpay.py`: subscription signature (incl. a guard that the order-field
  ordering is rejected); `test_unit.py`: charge activation, idempotent renewal,
  unknown-sub no-op, lifecycle deactivation.

### Changed
- Legacy `/api/billing/subscribe` remains the local-dev/test-only simulated path.

## [1.14.0]

### Added
- **Growth & safeguards (Phase 4 monetisation).**
  - **Per-user rate limiting** on LLM actions (query / ai-predict / marriage /
    chat): a sliding 60s window (`RATE_LIMIT_AI_PER_MIN`, default 15) returns
    **429** on breach, so a leaked session token can't drain credits at machine
    speed. In-memory (single-process); applied centrally in
    `check_credits_or_raise`.
  - **Subscription monthly soft-cap** (`SUBSCRIPTION_SOFT_CAP`, default 150):
    subscriber "unlimited" LLM usage is counted per calendar month and logged
    when it tops the cap — **never blocked** (the UX promise stands).
  - **Referral system:** every account gets a unique `referral_code`; signing up
    with one credits the new user (`REFERRAL_BONUS_REFEREE`, 50) and the referrer
    (`REFERRAL_BONUS_REFERRER`, 25). Code shown in the profile (with copy) and an
    optional field on the signup form; surfaced via `/api/auth/me`.
  - **Chat-history truncation:** the AI-chat prompt now keeps only the last
    `CHAT_HISTORY_TURNS` turns (default 3), capping prompt-token growth.

### Changed
- **Dropped the unused `user_wallets` table** — `users.credit_balance` is the
  single source of truth. Idempotent `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` migration; the dead
  create/seed code is gone.
- New config (all env-overridable): `RATE_LIMIT_AI_PER_MIN`,
  `SUBSCRIPTION_SOFT_CAP`, `REFERRAL_BONUS_REFEREE`/`_REFERRER`,
  `CHAT_HISTORY_TURNS`. New `users` columns: `monthly_ai_usage`, `usage_period`,
  `referral_code` (partial-unique index + backfill), `referred_by`.
- `test_unit.py` extended: rate-limit window, referral both-sides credit
  (+ unknown/self no-ops), and the soft-cap monthly counter/reset.

## [1.13.0]

### Added
- **Billing UX polish (Phase 3 monetisation).**
  - **Out-of-tokens paywall bottom sheet:** a `402` from any paid action now
    raises a recharge sheet (balance + the three INR packs + "Maybe later")
    instead of a bare `alert()`, going straight into Razorpay Checkout.
  - **Low-balance indicator:** the header/sidebar token count turns red and
    pulses below `LOW_BALANCE_THRESHOLD` (25, one AI reading) and is tappable to
    open the recharge sheet.
  - **"New Reading" button** in the AI chat bar — clears the conversation and
    restores the (chart-aware or generic) welcome. Frontend-only: the backend
    chat is stateless (history is re-sent each turn), so no session reset
    endpoint is needed.
  - **Usage dashboard** in the profile modal: tokens used this month + recent
    credit-ledger activity, from the new **`GET /api/billing/usage`** endpoint.
- Unit coverage for `billing_usage` (this-month debit sum, recent-activity
  ordering) in `test_unit.py`.

## [1.12.0]

### Added
- **Razorpay payments (Phase 2 monetisation).** Real one-time checkout for the
  INR token packs replaces the simulated flow:
  - `POST /api/billing/create-order` creates a Razorpay Order for the selected
    pack and records a pending transaction.
  - `POST /api/billing/verify-payment` validates the Checkout callback
    signature (HMAC-SHA256 of `order_id|payment_id`) and credits the user.
  - `POST /api/billing/webhook` is the authoritative server-to-server grant on
    `payment.captured`, verified against `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
  - Both paths funnel through an **idempotent** grant (atomic status flip on the
    `transactions.payment_intent_id` UNIQUE key) so credits land exactly once
    even if the callback and webhook both fire.
- **UPI / cards / netbanking** via Razorpay Checkout (`checkout.js`) in the
  billing UI, with a "Secured by Razorpay" / GST notice.
- **GST line item.** Pack prices are GST-INCLUSIVE (18%); `config.gst_breakdown`
  carves out base + tax (e.g. ₹29 = ₹24.58 + ₹4.42) for display/invoicing.
- New config: `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` /
  `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `RAZORPAY_ENABLED`, `GST_RATE` (all
  env-overridable); `razorpay` added to requirements (imported lazily).
- `test_razorpay.py` (CI): GST-inclusive split + payment/webhook signature
  verification.

### Changed
- Payments **fail closed** when Razorpay is unconfigured (503). The legacy
  `buy-credits` endpoint is now local-dev/test-only (gated on
  `VEDIC_ALLOW_SIMULATED_PAYMENTS`); `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is a reserved hook for a
  future international/card path. Recurring subscription billing (Astro Pass)
  remains deferred to a follow-up.

## [1.11.0]

### Changed
- **INR pricing (Phase 1 monetisation).** Credit packs are now INR token packs:
  Pocket ₹29 / 500, Kundli ₹49 / 1,125, Astro Pro ₹199 / 5,000 (1 credit == 1
  "token" in the UI). Subscription seed replaced with a single **Astro Pass
  ₹99/mo** plan (USD Basic/Premium + annual rows dropped for now). Billing
  currency is now `INR`; the simulated transaction records the configured
  currency instead of hardcoded `usd`.
- **Chart/Panchangam generation is now free** (`CREDIT_COST_CHART=0`) — it is
  pure local math with zero API cost, so only LLM-backed actions and the PDF
  report still cost credits. `check_credits_or_raise` short-circuits zero-cost
  actions (still auth-gated, but no debit and no `credit_logs` row).
- **Signup bonus reduced 100 → 25 credits** (one free AI overview).
- **Credit costs centralised in `config.py`** (`CREDIT_COST_CHART`/`_MARRIAGE`/
  `_PDF`/`_QUERY`/`_AI_PREDICT`, `SIGNUP_BONUS_CREDITS`, `BILLING_CURRENCY`,
  `CREDIT_PACKAGES`) — all env-overridable. Endpoint call sites no longer
  hardcode credit amounts. Current costs: chart 0, marriage 50, PDF 50,
  query/AI predict/chat 25.

## [1.10.0]

### Changed
- **AI backend switched from Ollama to OpenRouter** (OpenAI-compatible API, via
  the `openai` SDK). All LLM chat/prediction streaming (`llm_stream`, now using
  chat completions) and RAG embeddings (ingest + query) route through OpenRouter.
  Configuration is env-driven (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `MODEL_FAST`/
  `MODEL_BALANCED`/`MODEL_PREMIUM`, `MODEL_EMBEDDING`); AI endpoints use the
  backend-enforced `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL` (defaults to `MODEL_BALANCED`).
- `/api/health` now probes OpenRouter (key + model list) instead of Ollama.
- Removed all Ollama config/HTTP code; added `openai` to `requirements.txt`.

### ⚠️ Breaking / migration
- **Embedding model changed** from `nomic-embed-text` (768-dim) to
  `openai/text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim), so `EMBEDDING_DIM` is now 1536.
  **Existing RAG embeddings are incompatible and must be regenerated** — re-run
  `python3 ingest.py` (or repair) against the corpus; until then, stored 768-dim
  vectors are dropped at index load and dense search returns nothing.
- Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env` (see `.env.example`). The old
  `OLLAMA_*` / `VEDIC_EMBED_MODEL` env vars are no longer read.

## [1.9.0]

### Fixed
- **Sidebar language picker was stuck on English (mobile/Android)**: the drawer's
  "Language" button toggled the desktop header dropdown (`#lang-menu`), whose
  container (`.header-controls .lang-selector`) is `display:none` below 1024px, so
  nothing ever appeared and the language never changed. The sidebar now has its own
  inline language submenu (`#side-lang-sub`) that calls `changeLanguage()` directly
  and never depends on the hidden header control.

### Added
- **Mobile/Android side-navigation drawer is now in the source of truth**
  (`static/index.html`). The drawer had previously only existed in the gitignored
  Capacitor build artifact (`android/app/.../assets/public/index.html`), so any
  `cap copy` would have wiped it. It is now part of `static/` and regenerated into
  the Android bundle.
- **Login / account block pinned to the top of the sidebar**: shows *Sign In /
  Sign Up* when logged out and name + 🪙 credits + *Logout* when logged in, mirroring
  the header widget via `updateAuthUI()`.
- **Settings menu in the sidebar** consolidating existing controls (language,
  location, server settings, default Ayanamsa, default Panchangam system) and new
  options: text size (A−/A/A+, scales the root font for dense regional scripts),
  default landing page, lock location (skips the on-load GPS override), a daily
  Panchangam reminder (Capacitor `LocalNotifications`, native-only), and an
  About/version readout fed from `/api/version`.

### Notes
- A light/dark **theme** toggle was scoped but deferred: the current palette is
  already a light theme and ~74% of colors are hardcoded literals rather than CSS
  variables, so a reliable toggle needs a color-token refactor first.

## [1.8.8]

### Fixed
- **Wrong-script glyphs in localized panchangam/nakshatra labels**: Corrected ~20
  translation strings in `app.py` (`TITHI_TRANSLATIONS`, `NAKSHATRA_TRANSLATIONS`)
  and `pdf_generator.py` (gender labels, the "Combust" tag, and the Chennai/Madras
  Kannada city name) that contained characters from the wrong Indic script (e.g.
  Tamil/Devanagari/Telugu/Cyrillic glyphs leaking into Telugu/Malayalam/Kannada/
  Hindi values), so users in those languages saw garbled or mixed-script output.
  Also fixed two copy-paste content errors where the Kannada *Purva/Uttara
  Phalguni* nakshatras were filled with the *Ashadha* strings.
- **Malformed `chart_data` returned cryptic errors and churned credits**:
  `/api/download-pdf` now validates the chart payload up front and returns a clear
  `400` (instead of a leaked `KeyError` `500`), and `/api/ai-predict`,
  `/api/ai-predict-marriage`, and `/api/ai-predict-chat` now reject malformed
  input with a `400` *before* debiting credits (instead of a `200` event-stream
  carrying an opaque "Invalid chart_data" message).

### Changed
- Removed dead imports (`astro_engine.py`, `pdf_generator.py`,
  `muhurtham_engine.py`), fixed placeholder-less f-strings in `ingest.py`, and
  corrected the chart-response key list documented in `CLAUDE.md` to match the
  real top-level keys (`metadata`, `panchangam`, `placements`, `dasas`,
  `ashtakavarga`, `shadbala`).

## [1.8.7]

### Fixed
- **AI Chat History Validation (HTTP 422)**: Fixed HTTP 422 validation errors when sending messages in the Astro AI chat. The length limit (`max_length`) of the AI Chat history message content has been increased from `4000` to `65536` characters to accommodate long assistant responses returned by the model.

## [1.8.6]

Streaming keep-alive and connection stability fixes to prevent Cloudflare 524 timeouts.

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare 524 Timeouts**: Prevented HTTP 524 timeouts in streaming AI endpoints (`/api/query`, `/api/ai-predict`, `/api/ai-predict-marriage`, and `/api/ai-predict-chat`) by yielding an immediate newline chunk.
- **Lazy Prompt Evaluation**: Moved heavy computations (e.g. database RAG searches, batch embedding, and Ollama generator connection startup) inside the stream generator, executing them on a background worker thread.
- **Periodic Keep-Alives**: Yield keep-alive newlines every 5 seconds while waiting for the background worker thread to finish context building and LLM connection startup, keeping the socket active.

## [1.8.5]

Robustness — operational hardening (Group E).

### Added
- **`/api/live`** — a pure process-liveness probe (no DB/Ollama dependency).
  The container `HEALTHCHECK` now hits this instead of `/api/health`, so a
  transiently-down dependency no longer marks the container unhealthy (and
  triggers a restart) while it can still serve charts/panchangam/PDF.

### Changed
- **`/api/health`** now also flags a loaded-but-empty search index (books
  registered but 0 pages loaded — the silent embedding-dimension-mismatch
  failure mode) as `503 degraded`, and closes its DB connection via
  `try/finally`.
- **`init_user_db` migrations** only swallow the expected "duplicate column
  name" `OperationalError`; any other ALTER failure (locked DB, disk full,
  malformed type) is logged instead of silently ignored.
- **`/api/calculate-chart`** wraps its best-effort history-save in `try/finally`
  so a failure there can't leak the WAL connection.
- **`BOOKS_DIR`** defaults to a repo-relative `./books` (was a hardcoded
  personal absolute path); **ingest `NUM_THREADS`** defaults to the host CPU
  count and is overridable via `VEDIC_INGEST_THREADS`. `.env.example` documents
  the new vars (plus `VEDIC_LOG_LEVEL`).

## [1.8.4]

Robustness — CI & deterministic tests (Group D).

### Added
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — runs on every push/PR (no browser/Chrome
  needed): installs `requirements.txt`, an `import app` smoke check, the three
  pure-Python suites (`test_unit.py`, `test_muhurtham_engine.py`,
  `test_i18n_sync.py`), and `tools/check_js.py`.
- **`test_unit.py`** — 28 deterministic assertions over the high-risk pure
  logic: `get_current_dasa` window/boundary/fallback behaviour, the muhurtham
  `is_vishti_karana` edges and unknown-paradigm/activity guards, the
  longest-match value lookup (the Vaidhriti regression and Atiganda/ganda
  collision), `_safe_slug`/`_tithi_num`, and the credit debit→refund round-trip
  (including the 402 out-of-credits path) against an isolated temp DB.
- **`tools/check_js.py`** — `node --check` over the inline `<script>` blocks in
  `static/index.html`; the cheap guard that a frontend edit didn't break JS
  syntax.

## [1.8.3]

Robustness — frontend resilience (Group C, `static/index.html`).

### Fixed
- **`changeLanguage` no longer blanks the dashboard** on a stale/garbage
  `vedic_lang` from localStorage: it validates the code (`if
  (!localization[langCode]) langCode='en'`) before dereferencing the dict, and
  the ~35 bare `getElementById('lbl-…').innerText = …` writes now go through a
  guarded `setText()` helper so a missing/renamed id can't throw and abort the
  switch mid-way (which previously skipped the panchangam/calendar refresh).
- **Requests can no longer hang the UI forever.** `apiFetch` aborts a stalled
  non-streaming request after a timeout (default 30 s) via `AbortController`;
  streaming calls (`stream: true`) are exempt — an LLM stream legitimately runs
  for minutes and is bounded server-side by `LLM_STREAM_TIMEOUT`.
- **Double-submit guards** on the three paid generate flows: `generateBirthChart`
  (50 credits, `btn.disabled`), `generateJyothiAIReading` and
  `generateMarriageAICompatibility` (25 credits each, `is*Responding` flags) —
  a double-click no longer fires two charged requests that race shared state.
- **`getRegionalFestivals` hardened**: returns `[]` if the response lacks a Sun
  placement, and guards the `tithi.match(/Tithi (\d+)/)` access (a tithi string
  without the exact pattern previously threw on `null[1]`).

### Removed
- ~225 lines of dead Muhurtham UI handlers (`useMyLocationForMuhurtham`,
  `calculateMuhurthamWindow`, `renderMuhurthamResults`) that referenced `muh-*`
  / `muhurtham-results-panel` elements absent from the DOM — a latent trap that
  would throw if ever wired to a button.

## [1.8.2]

Robustness — observability & dependency resilience (Group B).

### Added
- **Structured logging.** `config.setup_logging()` configures the root logger
  once (level via `VEDIC_LOG_LEVEL`, timestamped `levelname name: message`
  format). Error/degradation paths across `config`, `search_engine`,
  `prediction_engine`, `app`, `ingest`, and `pdf_generator` now log at
  WARNING/ERROR instead of bare `print()` — so a silent quality drop (embed
  failure, RAG-search error, credit-refund failure, font-registration failure)
  is greppable and severity-filterable. (CLI progress output in `ingest.py` and
  the `astro_engine` `__main__` diagnostic stay as `print`.)
- **`EMBEDDING_DIM` startup probe** (`search_engine._probe_embedding_dim`):
  logs a loud ERROR if the embed model's real output dimension differs from
  `EMBEDDING_DIM` — previously every vector was silently dropped and the index
  loaded zero pages with no signal.

### Changed
- **One retry with backoff on transient Ollama failures** on the request-time
  paths: a shared `_http_json_post` for the embed/batch calls and an
  `_open_stream` for the generate stream retry once on a connection error (the
  blip a cold cloud model throws) but never on an HTTP 4xx. Mid-stream errors
  and stream failures are now logged.

## [1.8.1]

Robustness — input validation & config resilience (Group A of the robustness pass).

### Fixed
- **Config no longer crashes the app on a bad env var.** `VEDIC_EMBED_DIM`,
  `VEDIC_EMBED_TIMEOUT`, `VEDIC_LLM_TIMEOUT` are parsed via a new `_env_int`
  helper that warns and falls back to the default instead of raising
  `ValueError` at import (which previously took down the server, ingest, and
  diagnostics with a raw traceback).
- **Categorical inputs are now allow-listed** with `typing.Literal`, so a bad
  value gets a clean 422 instead of a downstream 500 — or, for the muhurtham
  paradigm, a silently *permissive* verdict. Constrained: `ayanamsa`, `gender`,
  `visual_style`/`chart_style`, `lang`, `regional_paradigm`, `target_activity`,
  `tier`, and the chat message `role`, across the request bodies and the GET
  `/api/muhurtham` query params.
- **Defense in depth in the engine:** `calculate_muhurtham` now raises
  `ValueError` on an unknown `regional_paradigm`/`target_activity` (previously
  they fell through every `if/elif` with no `else` and returned
  `VIVAHA: true`). The muhurtham API handlers already map that to 400.
- **String length caps** (`Field(max_length=…)`) on prompt- and DB-bound
  free-text fields (`name`, `place_name`, `client_name`, `query`, chat
  `content`, `full_name`, `location_name`, tokens, …) and a 50-item cap on chat
  `history`, bounding prompt size, memory, and stored data.

## [1.8.0]

Removed the Amruthathi (Anandadi) day-yoga entirely; the panchangam now exposes
only the 27 nitya yogas (the Sun+Moon `yogam`).

### Removed
- `astro_engine.py`: `AMRUTHATHI_YOGA_TABLE`, `AMRUTHATHI_YOGA_NAMES`,
  `get_amruthathi_yoga()`, and the `amruthathi_yoga` / `amruthathi_quality`
  fields from the panchangam output.
- `pdf_generator.py`: `translate_amruthathi_yoga()`, the per-language
  "Amruthathi" labels, and the PDF row.
- `static/index.html`: the Amruthathi panchangam tile (`item-amruthathi` /
  `lbl-amruthathi` / `panch-amruthathi`), `translateAmruthathiYoga()`, the
  per-language `amruthathi` labels, and the muhurtham "Anandadi Yogam" display.
- `app.py`: the Amruthathi line in the AI-prediction prompt.
- `muhurtham_engine.py`: the Anandadi-based auspiciousness gating and the
  `anandadi_yogam` field in `base_attributes`. The independent Saturday rule
  (only Rohini/Swati pass on a Saturday) is retained; the muhurtham verdict now
  rests on tithi, weekday, nakshatra, combustion, the nitya-yogam first-ghati
  block, and the seasonal/Panchaka/Kartari checks.
- `test_amruthathi_yoga.py` (the dedicated regression test).

### Breaking
- API response shape: `/api/calculate-chart` & `/api/panchangam` no longer
  return `panchangam.amruthathi_yoga` / `amruthathi_quality`; `/api/muhurtham`
  no longer returns `base_attributes.anandadi_yogam`. The bundled frontend is
  updated in lockstep; external clients reading those fields must adapt.

### Verified
- 27 nitya yogas intact; `test_muhurtham_engine.py` 4/4; `test_i18n_sync.py`
  passes; PDF renders; JS parses; daily-panchangam and muhurtham outputs carry
  the nitya yogam and no amruthathi/anandadi keys.

## [1.7.0]

Single source of truth for panchangam value translations.

### Added
- `translations.py` — the canonical nakshatra / yogam / karana localization
  tables (English canonical order + the five Indic languages), with an
  import-time validator that rejects misaligned arrays.
- `tools/gen_frontend_i18n.py` — code-gens the `I18N_VALUES` block in
  `static/index.html` from `translations.py` (`--check` mode for CI).
- `test_i18n_sync.py` — pure-Python guard (no browser): asserts the tables are
  length-aligned, the frontend block is in sync with `translations.py`, every
  entry is script-consistent (no wrong-block glyphs), the canonical order
  matches the engine, longest-match resolves every name (the Vaidhriti/Dhriti
  regression), and the PDF routes through the same source.

### Changed
- `pdf_generator.py` now imports its nakshatra/yogam/karana tables from
  `translations.py` instead of carrying its own copies; the three translate
  functions collapse to one-line wrappers over a shared `_translate_value`.
- `static/index.html`'s `translateNakshatra` / `translateYogam` /
  `translateKaranam` now read from the generated `I18N_VALUES` block via a
  shared `translateValue` helper — the inline per-language arrays are gone.

This removes the duplication that caused every prior translation drift bug
(the Malayalam-yogam-missing-two, the wrong-script glyphs, the Vaidhriti
mislabel). While reconciling the two former copies into one canonical set, four
genuine spelling disagreements between the frontend and PDF were resolved to the
correct form (Hindi Ashwini/Mrigashira/Ayushman, Tamil Vajra).

## [1.6.3]

Translation audit and fixes.

### Fixed
- **Yogam "Vaidhriti" mistranslated as "Dhriti"** in all five Indic languages
  (both the daily Panchangam UI and the PDF). The lookup matched the first
  English name found as a substring, so "vaidhriti" was swallowed by "dhriti"
  (index 7) before reaching its own entry (index 26). The matchers now pick the
  **longest** substring match, shared via a single helper
  (`matchCanonIndex` in the frontend, `_match_canon_idx` in `pdf_generator`),
  which also removes the triplicated lookup loops.
- **Wrong-script glyphs** (a character from one Indic block embedded in
  another language's string — invisible to the eye, e.g. a Telugu vowel sign
  in a Kannada word). Fixed five: the Kannada weekday "Shukravara" abbrev and
  the Kannada "Rasi Lord" label both carried a Telugu vowel sign; the Telugu
  "Venus" planet name began with Devanagari "शु"; the Malayalam Sunday abbrev
  was Tamil "ஞா"; and the Kannada "after/then" label was half Devanagari. A
  Unicode-block consistency scan over every per-language table now reports
  clean.
- Malayalam "Indra" yogam in the PDF used the anusvara form ഇംദ്രൻ; aligned to
  the standard conjunct ഇന്ദ്രൻ used elsewhere.
- Removed dead nakshatra fallbacks (chitra/mula/swati) that the longest-match
  lookup already covers.

### Notes
- The localized nakshatra/yoga/karana/tithi tables are still duplicated between
  `static/index.html` and `pdf_generator.py`; every table is now verified
  length-aligned (16/16 frontend blocks) and script-consistent, but a future
  single-source-of-truth refactor (serving the tables from one place) would
  prevent the class of drift bug entirely.

## [1.6.2]

Full-codebase audit: calculation, security, billing, prompt, and UI fixes.

### Fixed — astronomy/engine (`astro_engine.py`, `muhurtham_engine.py`)
- **Local→UT day rollover (critical).** The `% 24` wrap in the local→UT
  conversion dropped the calendar-day borrow, so every chart born before the
  timezone offset past midnight (e.g. before 05:30 IST) was computed a full
  day late — wrong Moon/nakshatra/lagna/panchangam/dasa tree. The muhurtham
  engine had the same bug (any UTC time 18:30–24:00 evaluated the next day).
- **Weekday (vara)** is now reckoned from the local civil day and rolls back
  before local sunrise (was UT-midnight based — wrong for evening births in
  negative-UTC zones and feeding the Amruthathi yoga + shadbala day lords).
- **Tamil/Malayalam solar day** now counts civil days since the sankranti
  (with the after-sunset rule) instead of mapping the Sun's in-sign degree
  1:1 to the day number (off by 1–2 near month end). Verified against
  published Thai 1/Chithirai 1 dates.
- **Shadbala**: cheshta bala elongation folded to ≤180° (values could exceed
  the 60-virupa max); masa/varsha lords convert the Sun's degrees to elapsed
  days (÷0.9856); Moon's paksha bala and Sun's ayana bala doubled per BPHS;
  tribhaga bala added; saptavargiya values corrected to the BPHS series
  (22.5/15/7.5/3.75/1.875) and moolatrikona (45) restricted to D1; Mercury
  moolatrikona starts at 16° Virgo.
- **Combustion** limits tighten when retrograde (Mercury 12°, Venus 8°).
- `format_jd_to_local_time` handles negative timezone offsets (Americas) and
  flags "(Next Day)" by comparing local civil dates.
- `get_julian_date` applies the Gregorian correction only from 1582-10-15.
- Kuja dosha check no longer crashes when Lagna/Moon/Venus placements are
  missing.
- Muhurtham: VIVAHA blockers are computed unconditionally so the
  `activity_compatibility` matrix no longer reports a Tuesday/Bharani/Vishti
  day as marriage-compatible when queried for another activity; Krishna
  Prathama (tithi 16) added to the forbidden set.

### Fixed — prediction layer (`prediction_engine.py`)
- "Yoga Karaka" was declared for the Lagna lord in **every** chart (house 1
  satisfied both the kendra and trikona condition); now requires a real
  kendra (4/7/10) and trikona (5/9) lordship.
- Kemadruma yoga could never fire (the Moon counted itself as its own kendra
  occupant).
- RAG fusion ranks dense and sparse hits within their own lists (proper RRF)
  instead of concatenated positions that always buried sparse hits.
- Prompt text ordinals ("1th"/"2th" from natal Moon) fixed; unparseable
  reference dates fall back to today instead of crashing.

### Fixed — security & billing (`app.py`, `config.py`)
- `/api/local-key` rejects requests carrying forwarding headers — behind a
  reverse proxy every request arrives from 127.0.0.1, which previously handed
  the shared API key to any remote client.
- Subscriptions now expire: `current_period_end` is enforced (one 30-day
  subscription previously granted unlimited usage forever).
- Credit check+debit is a single atomic conditional UPDATE (two concurrent
  requests could both pass the balance check); the `MAX(0,…)` clamp that
  silently corrupted the ledger is gone; failed operations (bad chart data,
  PDF errors, dead AI backend before any output) **refund** the debited
  credits.
- `buy-credits` accepts only the advertised packages (any integer, including
  negative, was previously priced at 799¢); transaction log + credit grant
  are now one DB transaction.
- Session expiry fails closed on malformed timestamps (was: +1 day grace).
- Mock OAuth (dev mode) can no longer log into accounts created via real
  provider verification; mock-created accounts are tagged `mock-<provider>`.
- Signup validates email format and password length and relies on the UNIQUE
  constraint instead of a racy check-then-insert.
- `.api_key` is written with 0600 permissions and only a key prefix is
  printed (stdout is typically redirected to a log).
- `POST /api/user/charts` was broken for history charts (SQL placeholders
  with no bindings → 500 + rolled-back insert).
- Input validation: lat/lon/date/time ranges on chart and muhurtham requests
  (422), bad `date_str` → 400, month-panchangam bounds (CPU-DoS guard);
  PDF temp files are deleted after download; chat history is capped at 20
  turns and unknown roles render as user content; the hardcoded "°N/°E"
  hemisphere labels in prompts and the PDF derive from the sign; the 403
  response no longer overrides a restrictive CORS configuration; several
  handlers close their SQLite connections on error paths.

### Fixed — AI streaming (`app.py`)
- The four copy-pasted Ollama generators are one shared helper that sends the
  `OLLAMA_API_KEY` Authorization header (cloud models previously failed only
  on the generate path), surfaces mid-stream `{"error": …}` chunks instead of
  silently truncating, and refunds credits when the stream dies before any
  content.

### Fixed — calendar (`app.py`)
- Month-calendar dedup now compares against the previous day only — a
  month-running set suppressed the Krishna-paksha Ekadashi/Pradosham/Ashtami
  that legitimately recur ~15 days after the Sukla ones.
- The daily endpoint double-fired every Ekadashi on the following day; the
  follow-day rule now detects the genuine skipped-Ekadashi case (sunrise
  tithi 10 → 12) and observes it on the Dwadashi.
- Janmashtami / Masa Shivaratri sample the midnight **following** the civil
  day (nishita), not the midnight at its start.

### Fixed — frontend (`static/index.html`)
- XSS: the marriage-AI stream was inserted into `innerHTML` unescaped
  (chat/Jyothi paths already escaped); it now escapes before markdown
  formatting.
- "Load individual chart" from marriage results referenced non-existent
  `in-year/month/day/hour/minute` inputs and threw before navigating; it now
  copies `in-dob`/`in-tob`.
- A failed chat stream left the `active-ai-typing-stream` id on the dead
  bubble, so the next reply rendered into the previous message.
- `calculate-chart` responses are checked for `response.ok` before being
  treated as chart data (an error body previously poisoned
  `calculatedChartData`).
- Malayalam yogam list was missing Shobhana/Atiganda (all later yogas shifted
  by two and the last two fell back to English); Malayalam Dhanu rasi was in
  Kannada script.
- Weekday in the birth report uses the engine's sunrise-aware vara instead of
  a UT-midnight JD formula.
- Italic markdown no longer pairs lone bullet asterisks across a line; the
  language dropdown stacks vertically; missing CSS added for the
  place-autocomplete dropdown, the typing cursor, and the `--accent-indigo` /
  `--bg-glass-hover` variables; Kali-year prefix localized for all languages
  in the daily panel; the dead client-supplied `model` field is no longer
  sent.

### Fixed — search/ingest (`search_engine.py`, `ingest.py`, `config.py`)
- Searches snapshot the index under the lock (a concurrent reload could swap
  `page_map` mid-search); one corrupt embedding BLOB no longer aborts the
  whole index load; wrong-dimension embeddings are rejected at ingest (they
  were stored, then silently unsearchable forever); ingest closes its DB/PDF
  handles on error paths, sends the Ollama auth header, and honours
  `VEDIC_EMBED_TIMEOUT`; the FTS index rebuilds when its row count diverges
  from `pages`; the query-embedding cache and batch-embed timeout are
  bounded.

## [1.6.1]

### Fixed
- Calendar festival detection. Ugadi previously appeared on ~12 wrong days a
  month because `"Tithi 1"` substring-matched Tithi 10–15, and lunar festivals
  were gated on the Gregorian month instead of the lunar month (so Ugadi/Rama
  Navami also fired in adjacent lunar months). Festivals are now matched on the
  exact tithi number and the correct `luni_month_idx`: Ugadi/Rama Navami/Hanuman
  Jayanti = Chaitra, Ganesha Chaturthi = Bhadrapada, Janmashtami = Shravana,
  Durga Ashtami = Ashvina. Ugadi also handles a skipped Chaitra Shukla Pratipada
  (falls back to the Chaitra new-moon day). Verified single-fire on the published
  dates for 2024–2028.
- Festival name translations in the calendar: corrected 19 mixed-script entries
  (e.g. Telugu glyphs in Kannada fields, Tamil in Malayalam) in the frontend
  `translateSpeciality` map, plus 8 in the backend festival table.

## [1.6.0]

### Added
- Adaptive default language by detected region. When the location resolves
  (GPS or IP), the UI language is chosen automatically: Tamil Nadu → Tamil,
  Kerala → Malayalam, Karnataka → Kannada, Andhra Pradesh/Telangana → Telugu,
  rest of India → Hindi, outside India → English. A manual language pick sets a
  `vedic_lang_explicit` flag that permanently overrides the adaptive default.

## [1.5.2]

### Changed
- The header location chip now shows the full **"City, State"** (first two parts
  of the resolved place name) instead of just the city.

## [1.5.1]

### Changed
- The header location chip now requests **precise GPS on page load** (prompting
  for permission), overriding the stored/IP location, and only falls back to
  IP geolocation when GPS is denied or unavailable. Previously IP was used
  silently on load and GPS only on tap. Browsers remember the grant, so repeat
  loads don't re-prompt.

## [1.5.0]

### Added
- Location chip in the header (next to the user name) that sets the place used
  for Panchangam accuracy. Tapping it requests precise GPS (with permission,
  for future phone apps / supported devices) and falls back to IP-based
  geolocation if denied or unavailable. On first visit the location is
  approximated silently by IP; the choice is persisted in the browser and, when
  signed in, synced to the account so it follows the user across devices.
- `/api/panchangam` and `/api/month-panchangam` now accept `lat`/`lon` query
  params (defaulting to Chennai) so the daily and monthly Panchangam are
  computed for the user's actual location.

### Changed
- Removed the manual Latitude/Longitude/City "Location Preferences" form from the
  user dashboard; location is now driven entirely by the header chip.

## [1.4.1]

### Performance
- Calendar month load (`/api/month-panchangam`) is now ~8× faster. Added a
  `light=True` mode to `astro_engine.get_astrological_chart` that skips the
  Vimshottari dasa tree, panchangam transition end-times, ashtakavarga, and
  shadbala — none of which the calendar (or daily newsletter) renders. The
  astrology tab (`/api/calculate-chart`) still computes the full chart.
- Calendar now caches each month's panchangam in the browser (keyed by
  year+month+language), so revisiting or navigating back to a month is instant
  with no refetch. Panchangam is deterministic, so cached months never go stale.

## [1.4.0]

### Added
- Amruthathi yoga (Tamil-panchangam birth-nakshatra × weekday day-yoga:
  Siddha / Amrita / Subha / Varjya / Nasha / Dagdha / Marana), surfaced in the
  chart panchangam, daily panchangam grid, AI grounding prompt, and PDF report
  in all six languages. Sourced from the Srirangam Kovil Vaakkiya Panchangam.
- `test_amruthathi_yoga.py` — pure-engine regression test for the yoga table.
- `favicon.ico` served from the app's brand logo (stops the `/favicon.ico` 404).

## [1.3.1]

- Baseline release prior to this changelog.
